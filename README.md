# App 10: SnapChat Clone

This app is a clone of the [SnapChat app](https://www.snapchat.com/). It allows users to

- Send *snaps* (i.e., messages and images) to other users
- Automatically delete snaps after reading

You can download and import the project in Android Studio, and run it in the emulator.
By default, the app uses a private Firebase project for authentication and storage.
To register and connect to your own project, delete `app/google-services.json` and
follow the instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#console).

Two demo accounts are available in case you don't want to register new users:
